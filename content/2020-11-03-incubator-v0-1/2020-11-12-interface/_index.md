title: Interface

I decided to go screenless for this project, and to use the screen that we already have in our pocket: the one from our phone. This choice is motivated by the resource I have at my disposal. Ideally, in the next version, I would add a tiny screen to make the incubator totally independent of other technologies. I don't want to force the use of a smartphone (because I would like to stop using mine).
