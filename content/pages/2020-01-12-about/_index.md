title: About
---

Bonjour, my name is Antoine Jaunard (1990) and I'm from Brussels, Belgium. I recently moved to Barcelona (ES) via a lovely detour by Amsterdam (NL).

This website is my digital studio, a place where I can experiment without constrains.

It's also my personal assistant, it helps me when I doubt on how to do something I've done before. It invites me to write (and then find) my personal knowledge online.
A tool for documenting the things I learn.

This website is built with a custom static site generator that I wrote in Python. It's open-source by default, as all the things I (try to) do. Sources are available on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/antoine.j/antoine.studio).

If you want to contact me, don't hesitate to [send me a message](mailto:antoine.stuff@pm.me) on my encrypted email address or to [follow me](https://merveilles.town/@focus404) on an alternative social network that I trust. You can speak to me in French, English, Dutch (*maar alleen een beetje*) or Spanish (*se amable, aprendo*).

Oh, there is also my [RSS feed](rss.xml).

## Fab Academy (2020)

I'm currently following the [Fab Academy](https://fabacademy.org/) at [Fab Lab Barcelona](https://fablabbcn.org/).

This intensive program is about designing and prototyping projects using digital fabrication tools and machine, such as: computer-controlled cutting, electronics, 3D scanning and printing, electronics design,computer-controlled machining, embedded programming, molding and casting, networking and communications, mechanical design, interface and application programming and machine design.

## Variable (2014-2019)

Together with Constant Mathieu, we'd run a small but good webdesign studio called [Variable](http://variable.club/), from 2014 to 2019. We'd put emphasis on creating our own custom tools to stay task-specific, light and versatile.

During our journey, we had the chance to work for/with a music festival (Schiev), a web radio (The Word Radio), a contemporary art museum (MIMA), a centre for contemporary art and an independent cinema (Netwerk Aalst), few architecture offices (Office KGDVS, V+, A Practice), an art school (La Cambre), and many more.

## Ecole de Recherche Graphique (2010-2014)

I'm graduated in Art and Graphic Design at the [Ecole de Recherche Graphique](http://erg.be) (ERG) of Brussels.
It was all about learning how to learn, hacking systems, building things without any budget, finding the right tone to communicate with others.
