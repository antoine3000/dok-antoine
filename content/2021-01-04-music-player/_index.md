title: Music player
---

I would like to have an easy solution to listen to music on the go. My ideal player has an SD card that contains music folders, a 3.5 mm jack input, a removable battery, a black and white screen that shows a minimal interface, and it runs on open-source software.

I haven't found the one I am ready to always take with me, so I will try to make it myself. This article will contain my explorations on trying to do so.
