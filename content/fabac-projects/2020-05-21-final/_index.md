# Introduction

A device that transforms the electrical activity of plants into a physical and meditative movement that we, humans, can observe and contemplate.

# Sensing

## electrical activity of a plant

An electrical potential sensor are used to detect the electrical activity of a plant, and therefore to deduce its health and its probable sensations.

## Human/plant interaction

Depending on the first phase (which is sensing the electrical activity of a plant), I may need an extra capacitive sensor to detect if a human is interacting with the plant.

  is a cybernetic lifeform, a plant in direct dialogue with a machine. Using its own internal
  electrical signals, the plant is interfaced with a robotic extension that drives it toward light.

## Technique
- [FYI on DIYs in PHL: Data Garden](http://philadelphia.thedelimagazine.com/9336/fyi-on-diys-phl-data-garden): "The sensors are “psycho galvanometers” which graph changes in galvanic response (electrical “skin” conductance/resistance) by producing a square wave of variable frequency and pulse width. Built from a [555 timer IC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_timer_IC) and a handful of electronic components, each sensor is attached to a leaf on a particular plant using an electrode of silver wire and conductive gel."
- [The Lessons To Be Learned From Forcing Plants To Play Music](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/21/807821340/the-lessons-to-be-learned-from-forcing-plants-to-play-music?t=1590083678926): The consumer version of the invention includes sensors that issue small signals through the plant, measuring variations in electrical resistance between two points within it. "The variation in the connection is largely related to how much water is between those two points, which changes a lot as the plant is moving water around while it's photosynthesizing, then we graphed that change as a wave, and then we translate that wave into pitch, so then essentially we're getting a stream of all these pitch messages coming from the plant."
