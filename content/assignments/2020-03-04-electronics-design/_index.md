I knew almost nothing about electronics before following the Fab Academy. I still have to learn and understand the very basics of a circuit and its composents, but also of electricity and its flow. To do so, I designed a pomodoro timer from scratch. I've learn a lot throughout the process and I've the feeling that this new knowledge will play a key role in what I'll do for my personal project and afterwards.
