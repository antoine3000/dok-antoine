title: Embedded programming
---

Two weeks ago, I designed a pomodoro timer during the [Electronics design](electronics-design.html) week. It's now time to program it. I'm going to write the piece of code that will light my LEDs as time goes by and find a way to send it to the ATtiny1614 chip. I'm going to focus on the latter: how to send a program (= program) a chip. Well, that was the plan.

Unfortunately, in the meantime, the coronavirus has hit Spain (and the whole world). We are now all in quarantine, with no access to the lab. I'll have to work from home, with the equipment I already have, nothing more.

For this reason, I'm going to use a [Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333). This tiny board is already equipped with 10 mini NeoPixels, 1 motion sensor, 1 temperature sensor, 1 sound sensor, 1 mini speaker, 2 push buttons, 1 slide switch, infrared receiver and transmitter and 8 alligator-clip friendly input/output pins. It's a perfect board for quick prototyping and code experiments.

## Pomodoro code

### How I want to use my pomodoro

- Press the left button to start the timer
- If it's running, press the left button to pause the timer
- If it's paused, press the left button to resume the timer
- If it's paused, press the right button to stop the timer
- When it's running, the LEDs light up one by one until the time limit
- When it's running and it's a work period, LEDs are red
- When it's running and it's a break period, LEDs are green
- When it's paused, all the LEDs are light up and blue

### The code that does this using the Arduino framework

<pre>
bool button_left;
bool button_right;
bool is_active = false;
bool is_paused = false;
int counter = 0;
int steps = 10;
int pomo = 30 * 600;
int pomo_work = pomo / 6 * 5;
int pomo_break = pomo / 6 * 1;

void setup() {
  CircuitPlayground.begin(); 
}

void on_second(int counter) {
  CircuitPlayground.clearPixels();
  if (counter <= pomo_work) {
    // work
    for (int i = 0; i <= steps; i++) {
      if (counter > pomo_work / steps * i) {
        CircuitPlayground.setPixelColor(i, 255,   0,   0);
      }
    }
  } else if (counter > pomo_work && counter <= pomo) {
    // break
    for (int i = 0; i <= steps; i++) {
      if (counter - pomo_work > pomo_break / steps * i) {
        CircuitPlayground.setPixelColor(i, 0,   255,   0);
      }
    }
  }
}

void bip() {
  CircuitPlayground.playTone(200, 10);
}

void loop() {
  button_left = CircuitPlayground.leftButton();
  button_right = CircuitPlayground.rightButton();

  if (counter > pomo) {
    CircuitPlayground.clearPixels();
    counter = 0;
  }

  if (button_left) {
    CircuitPlayground.clearPixels();
    if (!is_active) {
      is_active = true;
      bip();
    } else if (is_active && !is_paused) {
      is_paused = true;
      bip();
    } else if (is_paused) {
      is_paused = false;
      bip();
    }
  }

  if (button_right) {
    if (is_active && is_paused) {
      is_active = false;
      is_paused = false;
      counter = 0;
      CircuitPlayground.clearPixels();
      bip();
    }
  }
 
  if (is_active && !is_paused) {
    counter = counter + 1;
  }
  
  if (is_paused) {
    for (int i = 0; i <= steps; i++) {
      CircuitPlayground.setPixelColor(i, 0,   0,   55);
    }
  }
  
  if (counter % 10 == 0) {
    on_second(counter);
  }

  delay(100);
}

## PlatformIO

[PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) is a cross-platform, cross-architecture and multiple framework tool for embedded programming. It replaces Arduino IDE and offers a lot more subtilities and flexibility to write organized code for micro-controllers.

I use PlatformIO as a replacement for Arduino IDE because it allows me to use the text editor I want (I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), an hyperextensible Vim-based text editor) and because it integrates librairies of more than 700 differents boards, including the ones I use. It also has a unified debugger and a static code analyze which seems super useful for large scale projects.

### Initialization

Because PlatformIO is based on Python, the installation is pretty straight-forward using *pip*: `$ pip install -U platformio`

An empty folder to host the project is needed for PlatformIO to set up its environment. Make a new one and go in it `$ mkdir my-project && cd my-project` then type `$ pio init` to initialize this folder with the PlatformIO structure.

> `pio` is the the shortcut for `platformio`, it's the exact same thing but shorter

Then the structure should look like this:

<pre>
platformio.ini
src/
- main.cpp
- main.h
- …
lib/
- input/
- - input.cpp
- - input.h
- - …
- output/
- - output.cpp
- - output.h
- - …
boards/
- board_definition.json
</pre>

Next, search for the depedencies ID you might need, in this case the `Adafruit_CircuitPlayground.h`, by typing `$ pio lib search "header:Adafruit_CircuitPlayground.h"`. The lib ID I need is `602`.

Configure the project for this specific board, by following the datasheet found [here](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/boards/atmelsam/adafruit_circuitplayground_m0.html).

These values have to be written in the `platformio.io` file.

<pre>
[env:adafruit_circuitplayground_m0]
platform = atmelsam
board = adafruit_circuitplayground_m0
lib_deps =
  602
</pre>

### Run & upload

Write your program into the `src` folder. The librairies have to be included at the very beginning of your program's files. In this case, the Arduino framework `#include <Arduino.h>` and the Circuit Playground framework `#include <Adafruit_CircuitPlayground.h>`.

Once everything is set up (not that much actually, because PlatformIO does a few thing for us), launch the `$ pio run` command to run and compile the code.

If it has been verified correctly, send it to your board to make it alive by typing `pio run -t upload`.

I've been using my pomodoro timer every day since I coded it, the Circuit Playground is always by my computer to remind me to take a 5-minutes break every 25 minutes and help me stay focused.

# Programming the ATtiny1614

The ATtiny1614 isn't yet supported by PlatformIO and therefore needs another method to be programmed. Fortunately, [pyupdi](https://github.com/mraardvark/pyupdi) is here! Pyupdi is a Python UPDI driver for programming the "new" tinyAVR and megaAVR devices.

## Install

`git clone https://github.com/mraardvark/pyupdi`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Compile

The first thing to do is to compile the code with the Arduino IDE and then send it with `pyupdi`.
To be able to compile the code, first install the [megaTinyCore](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/megaTinyCore) library using the Libraries manager into the Arduino IDE and select the ATtiny1614 board.

From the Arduini IDE console, locate the `.ino.hex` that is generated when you compile and copy its path. It should be something like `/tmp/arduino_build_342195/Blink.ino.hex`.

## Upload

Once your program is correctly compiled, open a terminal to send it to your device.

First, run `ls /dev/* | greb usb` to know the name of your port. It should look like `/dev/ttyUSB0`.

Then, run pyupdi with the name of the board you're working on `tiny1614`, the port where you want to send the code `/dev/ttyUSB0` and the code itself `/temp/arduino_buid_342195/Blink.ino.hex`.

<pre>
pyupdi.py -d tiny1614 -c /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600 -f /tmp/arduino_build_342195/Blink.ino.hex -v
</pre>

# The basic way: Arduino IDE

One can also use Arduino IDE to load a piece of code into a device. It works perfectly well even if this solution is more basic and doesn't allow a lot of  fine tuning.

1. [Download Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and install it on you computer
2. Find and install the Circuit Playground library with the built-in `Boards Manager`
3. Verify the code
4. Upload the code
