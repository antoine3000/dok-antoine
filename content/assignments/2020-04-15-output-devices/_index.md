title: Output devices
---

This week's assignement is about output devices: we are learning how to make various
motors work, what are their mechanisms and principles, when and why use a
specific one instead of another.

I might enough material at my place to build an incubator system that could helps
[Maud Bausier](https://maudb.gitlab.io/dok/), my partner, that initiated this
project but needed help to finish it, to grow mycellium or any fermented food (tempeh, sriracha, etc.).

I'm going to use a thermistor (to know to temperature inside the incubator), a thermopad (to
warm it up), a fan (to cool it down), a LCD screen (to know what's going on) and
two push buttons to adjust the desired temperature inside the incubator.

# Motors

When current goes through a wire, a magnetic field is generated around it. The
higher the current, the greater the field.

How much torque, rotational force, depends on the motor's input current. More
current implies stronger magnetic field in the coils, that means more
attraction/repulsion.

How much current a motor can tolerate depends on how thick the coils are
(thicker implies more current and hence more torque).

A quick tour of the most used motors in electronic projects.

## DC

Maybe the most common one, it converts current electrical energy into mechanical energy.

### Brushless

## Steppers

## Servo

## Solenoids

# Controlling motors

## Relays

## MOSFET

# Electroluminescence actuators

## LED

## LCD screen
