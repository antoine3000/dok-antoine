It's the 4th week of the Fab Academy, we're now exploring the process of electronics production: How to make a in-circuit programmer from a [printed circuit board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board) (PCB) and several electronic components.

# Making an in-circuit programmer

> In-system programming (ISP), also called in-circuit serial programming (ICSP), is the ability of some programmable logic devices, microcontrollers, and other embedded devices to be programmed while installed in a complete system, rather than requiring the chip to be programmed prior to installing it into the system.

## FTDI
climb

## UPDI
conventional

## Milling

The drills are super fragile, we have to manipulate them with extra attention.

### Prepare the files (traces and interior)
- Import the PNG in [Fabmodules](http://fabmodules.org/)
- Output:`Roland Mill`
- Process for interior: `PCB traces (1/64)`
- Process for traces: `PCB outline (1/32)`
- Machine: `SRM-20`
- Speed (mm/s): `4`
- x0, y0, z0: `0, 0, 0`
- zjog (mm): `12`
- `Calculate` & `Save`

### Milling process
- Tape the back of a PCB with double-face tape (don't overlap to avoid different levels)
- Place the PCB on the board of the machine (parallel is better)
- Change the drill depending on the task you're going to achieve (32 or 64)
- Set up the X and Y coordinates depending on the design and the space available on the PCB
- Set up the Z so the drill touch the PCB, even a bit more if necessary
- Load the files and press the `setup` button.

#### Attention
- 

## Soldering

### group assignment
characterize the design rules for your PCB production process

### individual assignment
make an in-circuit programmer by milling and stuffing the PCB, test it, then optionally try other PCB processes
