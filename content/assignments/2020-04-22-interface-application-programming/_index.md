title: Interface application programming
tags: draft
---

- First step: choose a language.
- tell my experience with programming language
  - html/css
  - javascript
  - pascal
  - processing (Java)
  - Arduino (C)
  - P5JS (javascript)
  - python
- "Python is a beautiful language"
- openframework
- matplotlib "highly recommended"
- deeplearning?

# idea

Write a program and build an interface for my final project.

Write a program that connects to a plant API and gets desired values concerning light, temperature, moisture.

Build an interface


Websockets
nodejs


# Journal

The installations of openframework and Processing seems broken on Arch Linux. I spent a major part of my time trying to make them work.

Processing seems easier to use but is also a bit limitied compared to openframework.

The two languages I want to learn are Python and C++.

C++ seems to be a very good candidate for me since it is used for microcontrollers (I like the idea of being closer to the machine) and for creative coding (with openframework).

+ Continue to learn Python for the everyday use seems to be a good idea.
