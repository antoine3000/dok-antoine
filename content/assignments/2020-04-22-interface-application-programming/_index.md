title: Interface application programming
---

This week is devoted to programming interfaces and applications, a subject that I really like. I would not say that I am a good programmer, I have little experience. But it's something I love to do: solve logic problems, create software that produces the result I want (or the result I didn't expect, because I also find unexpected things beautiful).

## My coding journey

### Processing (Java / Javascript)

In art school, I had two years of digital art workshops. The main tool we used in this class was [Processing](https://processing.org/). And it was so refreshing. Being able to produce an artistic installation with algorithms was something I was looking for.

But it was also the rise of another movement: Internet culture. This quickly made me drop Processing for its javascript version, [p5js](https://p5js.org/) and html/css, in order to create websites. It was not really good, Processing (p5js) is not so exciting when it is stuck in a browser. But the mix of graphic design and coding was definitely the right direction for me. I had the insight I needed with Processing and the motivation to continue creating websites, and then to found my web studio.

### Javascript

In my web studio, I made websites with html/css and Javascript. I used to mainly use [vanilla Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) to build reactives web interfaces.

I always found it tricky and not really intuitive. Even if Javascript is powerful and can do many things, I find that it is also a kind of poison for the web: websites get heavier, they track you more and more, and they need an updated browser to be viewed.

It is not a language in which I would like to invest myself more. I would even prefer the Internet without it, without advertising and tracking, filled with lighter websites that run on older browsers.


### Python

Then I discovered Python, a language that also has many uses, but outside the browser. I'm at the very beginning of my Python's journey but I can already tell that I like it!

My static website you are reading now is the result of the second program I wrote in Python (the first was a little expense tracking tool). I wrote about it [during the first week](project-management.html) of the academy.

I like the natural feeling of writing on Python, removing the syntax barrier and inviting us to focus on logic.

### TidalCycles (Haskell)

I sometimes make live-coding music. Live-coding means that I write music in real-time, starting from a blank file. Composing rhythms with logic loops, creating synth melodies with random variables.

The pattern language I use is called [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org) and it's written in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). I couldn't tell you a lot about the Haskell language, but I can tell you that programming music is super fun and reveal its beauty on performances rather than on pure compositions.

### Arduino (C++)

Since the beginning of the academy, I started to learn a little C ++ and the Arduino framework in order to speak with microcontrollers and to obtain an interaction between machines and their environment.

I really like the new perspective that this gives to my coding practice: I do not only write software from my computer for other computers, but I now interact with the "real" world, being able to better understand and interact with it.

Learning the basics of C ++ helps me to better understand some of the main programming concepts, which I had previously learned on the fly, without structure.

## What's next

The feeling of having given up on processing too soon mixed with the new excitement of writing programs for microcontrollers using Arduino and C++ makes me want to dig a lot more in that direction.

### openFrameworks

But not especially with Processing itself, which now seems a bit limited compared to what I want to do, but with [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/), another Processing type framework, written in C++ (like Arduino) and capable of creating more powerful programs and therefore produce more complex artistic installations or tools or whatever you want.

# Journal

The installations of openframework and Processing seems broken on Arch Linux. I spent a major part of my time trying to make them work.

Processing seems easier to use but is also a bit limitied compared to openframework.

The two languages I want to learn are Python and C++.

C++ seems to be a very good candidate for me since it is used for microcontrollers (I like the idea of being closer to the machine) and for creative coding (with openframework).

Continue to learn Python for the everyday use seems to be a good idea.
