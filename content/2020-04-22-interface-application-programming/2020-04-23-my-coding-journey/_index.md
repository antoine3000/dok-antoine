# Processing (Java / Javascript)

In art school, I had two years of digital art workshops. The main tool we used in this class was [Processing](https://processing.org/). And it was so refreshing. Being able to produce an artistic installation with algorithms was something I was looking for. But it was also the rise of another movement: Internet culture. This quickly made me drop Processing for its javascript version, [p5js](https://p5js.org/) and html/css, in order to create websites. It was not really good, Processing (p5js) is not so exciting when it is stuck in a browser. But the mix of graphic design and coding was definitely the right direction for me. I had the insight I needed with Processing and the motivation to continue creating websites, and then to found my web studio.

# Javascript

In my web studio, I made websites with html/css and Javascript. I used to mainly use [vanilla Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) to build reactives web interfaces. I always found it tricky and not really intuitive. Even if Javascript is powerful and can do many things, I find that it is also a kind of poison for the web: websites get heavier, they track you more and more, and they need an updated browser to be viewed. It is not a language in which I would like to invest myself more. I would even prefer the Internet without it, without advertising and tracking, filled with lighter websites that run on older browsers.

# Python

Then I discovered Python, a language that also has many uses, but outside the browser. I'm at the very beginning of my Python's journey but I can already tell that I like it! My static website you are reading now is the result of the second program I wrote in Python (the first was a little expense tracking tool). I wrote about it [during the first week](fabac-assignments-project-management.html) of the academy. I like the natural feeling of writing on Python, removing the syntax barrier and inviting us to focus on logic.

# TidalCycles (Haskell)

I sometimes do live coding music. Live coding means that I write music in real time, from a blank file. Compose rhythms with logical loops, create synth melodies with random variables. The pattern language I use is called [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org) and it is written in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). I couldn't tell you much about the Haskell language, but I can tell you that programming music is super fun to do and reveals its beauty on performances rather than on pure compositions.

# Arduino (C++)

Since the beginning of the academy, I started to learn a little C ++ and the Arduino framework in order to speak with microcontrollers and to obtain an interaction between machines and their environment. I really like the new perspective that this gives to my coding practice: I do not only write software from my computer for other computers, but I now interact with the "real" world, being able to better understand and interact with it. Learning the basics of C ++ helps me to better understand some of the main programming concepts, which I had previously learned on the fly, without structure.

# What's next

The feeling of having given up on processing too soon mixed with the new excitement of writing programs for microcontrollers using Arduino and C++ makes me want to dig a lot deeper into the relationship between creative coding and the physical world.

## openFrameworks

To explore that path, I don't want to specifically use Processing itself, which now seems a bit limited compared to what I want to do, but [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/), another Processing-type framework, written in C++ (like Arduino) and able to create more powerful programs and therefore produce more complex artistic installations or tools or whatever you want.
