title: Interface
---

I decided to go screenless for this project, and to use the screen that we already have in our pocket: the one from our phone. This choice is motivated by the resource I have at my disposal. Ideally, in the next version, I would add a tiny screen to make the incubator totally independent of other technologies. I don't want to force the use of a smartphone (because I would like to stop using mine).

To do this, I have created a simple web interface that can be reached from the Wifi network provided by the ESP32 microchip. The interface allows us to see and change the temperature inside the incubator.
