title: Arduino IDE
---

One can also use Arduino IDE to load a piece of code into a device. It works perfectly well even if this solution is more basic and doesn't allow a lot of fine tuning. Because this software is well maintained and massively used, it makes it a very good tool for quickly prototyping without detours.

1. [Download Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and install it on you computer
2. Find and install the Circuit Playground library with the built-in `Boards Manager`
3. Verify the code
4. Upload the code
