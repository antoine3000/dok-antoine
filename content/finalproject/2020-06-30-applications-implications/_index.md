title: Applications and implications
---


For this weeks's assignement, we were asked to answer a series of questions about our final project. It won't be easy in my case because my project is still unclear but, I guess that's the point of this week: write some very practical facts and see where my main idea goes, and how far I can define it.

# What will it do?

# Who's done what beforehand?

# What will you design?

# What materials and components will be used?

# Where will come from?

# How much will they cost?

# What parts and systems will be made?

# What questions need to be answerd?

# How will it be evaluated?
