# Making the mold

- freecad design
- laser cut test
- laser cut test, clean the lens
- assembling, holes too small, had to re-do them with the hand drill

lasercut acrylic transparent 5mm: 95% power, 0.45 time, 20000HZ

# Preparing the casting

- Spray release agent, mask and gloves, wait for 10 min
- calcuate the volumes I need to cast (Pi * radius * radius * height)
- 50% of A, 50% of B, mix super well for 5 min
- put a timer of ~ 20 mins (according to the specs of the silicon I'm using)
- Pour the solutions slowly, to avoid the creation of bubbles, in the mold
- Wait for 5 hours

## Other side

- Unscrew the structure and flip the mold
- Clean everything
- Place the disk in the center, on the top of the first layer of silicon
- tape the holes (with transparent tape)
- Calculate the new volume to cast, and prepare the silicon mix
- Cast and try to reach around 1 or 2 mm of thickness

# Casting

## Mistakes encountered

- The two holes in the design were too small compared to the pipes, I had to enlarge them with an hand-drill
- I calculate the volume without substracting the inner pieces, I ended with a waste of silicon (which is expensive)
- I've used white tape, which is way more too visible and thus un-aesthetic
- The first try of casting the second layer was too thin, the inflation worked but I tore the membrane
