# Introduction

An electronic board that receives signals from [an input](green-observatory-input.html) and controls an air flow using an air pump and four solenoids.

Note that this project is inspired by [Programmable Air](https://www.programmableair.com/), I simplified it by using one pump instead of two. Once again, thanks to open-source :)

# Key electronics components

## Air pump

The [air pump](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10398) operates at 12V and has enough suction for my project.

## Solenoids
