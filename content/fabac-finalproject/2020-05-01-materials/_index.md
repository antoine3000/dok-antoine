The device is made up of two elements: the *plant* and the *clone*.

# The plant

The *plant* is the element connected to a plant, it has sensors and a microcontroller equipped with a WiFi transceiver module ([ESP32-WROOM-32](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/espressif-systems/ESP32-WROOM-32/1904-1010-1-ND/8544305)).

# The clone

The *clone* is the element that represents the health and activity of the plant. It is also equipped with ESP32-WROOM-32, and receives its instructions via the WiFi protocol. Depending on the messages it receives, it turns on or off a fan that inflates or deflates a balloon, which represent a kind of pulmonary movement.
