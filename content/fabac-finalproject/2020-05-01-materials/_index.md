## Questions

### Electrical activity

It doesn't seem easy to be able to measure the electrical activity of a plant because of its very low voltage. A voltage amplifier seems needed to read a decent value. But how to make it by myself at a low-cost?

### Touche sensor

The touche sensor build seems to be doable with these two sources:
