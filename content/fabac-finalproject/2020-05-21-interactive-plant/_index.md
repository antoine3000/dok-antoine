# Sensing

## electrical activity of a plant

An electrical potential sensor are used to detect the electrical activity of a plant, and therefore to deduce its health and its probable sensations.

## Human/plant interaction

Capacitive sensors are used to detect if a human is interacting with the plant.

## Technique
- [ FYI on DIYs in PHL: Data Garden]( FYI on DIYs in PHL: Data Garden): "The sensors are “psycho galvanometers” which graph changes in galvanic response (electrical “skin” conductance/resistance) by producing a square wave of variable frequency and pulse width. Built from a [555 timer IC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_timer_IC) and a handful of electronic components, each sensor is attached to a leaf on a particular plant using an electrode of silver wire and conductive gel."

"The variation in the connection is largely related to how much water is between those two points, which changes a lot as the plant is moving water around while it's photosynthesizing, then we graphed that change as a wave, and then we translate that wave into pitch, so then essentially we're getting a stream of all these pitch messages coming from the plant."
