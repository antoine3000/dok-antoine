      Interface application programming
    
  </h1>
  <p>This week is devoted to programming interfaces and applications, a subject that I really like. I would not say that I am a good programmer, I have little experience. But it's something I love to do: solve logic problems, create software that produces the result I want (or the result I didn't expect, because I also find unexpected things beautiful).</p>

<h2>My coding journey</h2>

<h3>Processing (Java / Javascript)</h3>

<p>In art school, I had two years of digital art workshops. The main tool we used in this class was <a target="_blank" href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>. And it was so refreshing. Being able to produce an artistic installation with algorithms was something I was looking for.</p>

<p>But it was also the rise of another movement: Internet culture. This quickly made me drop Processing for its javascript version, <a target="_blank" href="https://p5js.org/">p5js</a> and html/css, in order to create websites. It was not really good, Processing (p5js) is not so exciting when it is stuck in a browser. But the mix of graphic design and coding was definitely the right direction for me. I had the insight I needed with Processing and the motivation to continue creating websites, and then to found my web studio.</p>

<h3>Javascript</h3>

<p>In my web studio, I made websites with html/css and Javascript. I used to mainly use <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">vanilla Javascript</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> to build reactives web interfaces.</p>

<p>I always found it tricky and not really intuitive. Even if Javascript is powerful and can do many things, I find that it is also a kind of poison for the web: websites get heavier, they track you more and more, and they need an updated browser to be viewed.</p>

<p>It is not a language in which I would like to invest myself more. I would even prefer the Internet without it, without advertising and tracking, filled with lighter websites that run on older browsers.</p>

<h3>Python</h3>

<p>Then I discovered Python, a language that also has many uses, but outside the browser. I'm at the very beginning of my Python's journey but I can already tell that I like it!</p>

<p>My static website you are reading now is the result of the second program I wrote in Python (the first was a little expense tracking tool). I wrote about it <a target="_blank" href="project-management.html">during the first week</a> of the academy.</p>

<p>I like the natural feeling of writing on Python, removing the syntax barrier and inviting us to focus on logic.</p>

<h3>TidalCycles (Haskell)</h3>

<p>I sometimes make live-coding music. Live-coding means that I write music in real-time, starting from a blank file. Composing rhythms with logic loops, creating synth melodies with random variables.</p>

<p>The pattern language I use is called <a target="_blank" href="https://tidalcycles.org">TidalCycles</a> and it's written in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>. I couldn't tell you a lot about the Haskell language, but I can tell you that programming music is super fun and reveal its beauty on performances rather than on pure compositions.</p>

<h3>Arduino (C++)</h3>

<p>Since the beginning of the academy, I started to learn a little C ++ and the Arduino framework in order to speak with microcontrollers and to obtain an interaction between machines and their environment.</p>

<p>I really like the new perspective that this gives to my coding practice: I do not only write software from my computer for other computers, but I now interact with the "real" world, being able to better understand and interact with it.</p>

<p>Learning the basics of C ++ helps me to better understand some of the main programming concepts, which I had previously learned on the fly, without structure.</p>

<h2>What's next</h2>

<p>The feeling of having given up on processing too soon mixed with the new excitement of writing programs for microcontrollers using Arduino and C++ makes me want to dig a lot more in that direction.</p>

<h3>openFrameworks</h3>

<p>But not especially with Processing itself, which now seems a bit limited compared to what I want to do, but with <a target="_blank" href="https://openframeworks.cc/">openFrameworks</a>, another Processing type framework, written in C++ (like Arduino) and capable of creating more powerful programs and therefore produce more complex artistic installations or tools or whatever you want.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Journal</h1>

<p>The installations of openframework and Processing seems broken on Arch Linux. I spent a major part of my time trying to make them work.</p>

<p>Processing seems easier to use but is also a bit limitied compared to openframework.</p>

<p>The two languages I want to learn are Python and C++.</p>

<p>C++ seems to be a very good candidate for me since it is used for microcontrollers (I like the idea of being closer to the machine) and for creative coding (with openframework).</p>

<p>Continue to learn Python for the everyday use seems to be a good idea.</p>
