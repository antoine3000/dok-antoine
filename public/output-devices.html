      Output devices
    
  </h1>
  <p>This week's assignement is about output devices: we are learning how to make various
motors work, what are their mechanisms and principles, when and why use a
specific one instead of another.</p>

<p>I might have enough material at home (covid-19 restrictions) to build an incubator system that could helps
<a target="_blank" href="https://maudb.gitlab.io/dok/">Maud Bausier</a>, my partner who initiated this
project but needed help to finish it, to grow mycellium or any fermented food (tempeh, sriracha, etc.).</p>

<p>I'm going to use a thermistor (to know to temperature inside the incubator), a thermopad (to
warm it up), a fan (to cool it down), a LCD screen (to know what's going on) and
two push buttons to adjust the desired temperature inside the incubator.</p>

<h1>Motors</h1>

<p>But first, I needed some basics about motors: a motor is mainly made of coils
and magnets. When current goes through a coil, a magnetic field is generated around it. The
higher the current, the greater the field. This magnetic field creates polarity
which is used to create a rotational force. This force is called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque">the
torque</a> and its value depends on the motor's input current. More
current implies stronger magnetic field in the coils, that means more attraction/repulsion.</p>

<h2>DC motor</h2>

<p>Maybe the simplest and most common motor in electronics, it converts current electrical energy into mechanical energy.
The motor spins in one direction. Switching its polarity changes its direction.
Varying the current supplied varies the speed of the motor.</p>

<p>There are two main kinds of DC motor: the brushed one and the brushless one. The
first one is more commonly used because it is the cheaper one. The brushless is bit
more expensive, but it is less noisy and can last a lot longer because it
doesn't need to be maintained, simply because there is almost no friction inside
it.</p>

<h2>Stepper motor</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stepper motors are different than regular DC motors in that they donâ€™t turn continuously, but move in a series of steps. A stepper motor is a motor that has multiple coils, not just one. By energizing each coil in sequence, you attract the shaft magnets to each coil in the sequence, and you can turn the motor in precise steps, rather than simply rotating continually.</p>

<h2>Servo</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Servo is a small device that has an output shaft. This shaft can be
  positioned to specific angular positions by sending the servo a coded signal.
  As long as the coded signal exists on the input line, the servo will maintain
  the angular position of the shaft. As the coded signal changes, the angular
  position of the shaft changes. </p>

Arduino</a></p>

<p>As we can see on the image above, a servo motor is composed by a DC motor, a
potentionmeter and embedded circuit to control them.</p>

<p>Servo motor appears to be the perfect candidate when we need a full control of
the rotation angle, direction and speed of a motor.</p>

<h1>MOSFET</h1>

<p>A MOSFET (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) is a semiconductor
device which is used for switching electronic signals.</p>

<h1>Prototyping an incubator</h1>

<p>I would like to prototype an incubator by using the devices I already have. I'll
do it by following the spiral methodology: a first round with the basic
features, and then other ones with additional options.</p>

<h2>Round #01: the basics</h2>

<p>For the first round, I would like to control a fan and a thermoelectric cooler
depending on the ambient temperature, using a NODEMCU Amica.</p>
