  <h1>3D Scan</h1>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://alicevision.org/#meshroom">Meshroom</a> is an open-source photogrammetry software.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Photogrammetry is the art, science and technology of obtaining reliable information about physical objects and the environment through the process of recording, measuring and interpreting photographic images and patterns of electromagnetic radiant imagery and other phenomena.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<ol>
<li>Download the binary from Meshroom home page</li>
<li>Unzip it in any folder.</li>
<li>Open a terminal and from this folder run <code>./Meshroom</code> to launch the GUI.</li>

<h1>Print a 3D test file</h1>

<p>For this week's group assignement, I teamed up with <a target="_blank" href="https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/barcelona/students/tue-ngo/">Tue</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/barcelona/students/david-prieto/">David</a>. We picked a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1363023">test file</a> from Thingiverse in order to test different features of one of the 3D printers we have in Fab Lab Barcelona, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.creality3d.shop/products/creality-cr-10s-s5-3d-printer-diy-kit-large-printing-size-500x500x500mm">Creality3D CR-10 S5 3D</a>.</p>

<p>This file allows us to test these features: Z-height check, warp check, spike, hole in wall, raft test, overhang Steps 50° - 70°, 2 different extrusion widths: 0.48mm &amp; 0.4mm.</p>

<p>There is a computer in the printing room, attached to the machines, that have all the presets of the different printers. It's therefore easier to directly use it in order to slice our model instead of searching the presets and install them on my personal laptop.</p>

<p>This computer use <a target="_blank" href="https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura">Ultimaker Cura 4.4.0</a>, wich is unfortunately not open-source. I'll try later to slice my models myself using <a target="_blank" href="https://slic3r.org/">Slic3r</a> wich seems to be a very good alternative. The difference seems to be the interface that is less user friendly, but does it really matter?</p>

<h2>Specific settings that we'd to specify</h2>

<ul>
<li>layer height: <code>0.25mm</code></li>
<li>Wall thickness: <code>0.8mm</code> (= 2 lines)</li>
<li>Infill: <code>10%</code></li>
<li>Print speed: <code>60mm/s</code> (= maximum for this printer)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Print something - An oloid</h1>

<p>I'm exploring different types of shapes that could eventually be interesting regarding my final project. One of these is the oloid.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An oloid is a three-dimensional curved geometric object that was discovered by Paul Schatz in 1929. It is the convex hull of a skeletal frame made by placing two linked congruent circles in perpendicular planes, so that the center of each circle lies on the edge of the other circle. The distance between the circle centers equals the radius of the circles. One third of each circle's perimeter lies inside the convex hull, so the same shape may be also formed as the convex hull of the two remaining circular arcs each spanning an angle of 4π/3.</p>

</div>

<p>An oloid is a special shape because it only has one side. That means that if you make it roll on a flat surface, all of its surface will touch the flat surface at some point.</p>

<h2>Model</h2>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a>, the 3D CAD modeller that we use by writing code (as I said <a target="_blank" href="computer-aided-design.html">here</a>) has a great function called <code>hull()</code> that displays the <a target="_blank" href="https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Convex_hull_2/index.html">convex hull</a> of child nodes.</p>

<p>So that why I chose to use OpenSCAD to model this particular shape instead of other more conventional tool as FreeCAD.</p>

<pre>
$fn = 180; // resolution
radius = 20;

hull() {
  cylinder(r=radius, h=0.1, center=true);   
  rotate(a=90, v=[1,0,0]) {
    translate([radius,0,0]) {
      cylinder(r=radius, h=0.1, center=true);
    }
  }
}
</pre>
