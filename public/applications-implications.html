      Applications and implications
    
  </h1>
  <p>For this weeks's assignement, we were asked to answer a series of questions about our final project. I don't really know where I'm going with my project but I guess that's the point of this week: write some very practical facts and see where my main idea goes, and how far I can define it. Let's do that.</p>

<p>This project is (if everything goes fine) one of the first step into something I would like to explore: Communication between plants and how plants reacts to their environement, to their peers, to us.</p>

<p>I've no background in sciences or biology or anything that could help me have a better view on what's happening underground, where the roots of the plants are. But, I've a background in art and graphic design and I'm super curious about nature, the plants and their behaviours.</p>

<p>But before trying to understand what's happening between complex structrures such as plants, a good first step for me is to explore and familiarize myself with the data I can collect from plants and their environement, with the tools we have in the fablabs and with the process of digital fabrication.</p>

<p>The machine I have in mind is able to get the data from a plant [electrical signal] and its environment [air temperature, soil temperature, light level, soil moisture level, human interaction] and transform it into something visual.</p>

<p>I'm thinking about a machine that can represent the movement of the breathing, by using mechanics instead of air, and therefore I can have the control on what's happening, ahd what kind of movement is made.</p>

<p>I imagine a grid of rods pushing into a soft material and therefore deforming it. Each stem is linked to a data type (temperature, moisture level, etc.) and adjust its level depending on the state of the data. The soft material takes a unique shape according to plant's needs.</p>

<p>The electrical signal of the plant, collected using electrodes and a signal amplifier, adjust the level of the LED's to give a visual signal on the pulses of the plants.</p>

<p>If a human touches to plant, the installation reacts as well, inviting the people to give a special attention to it. This can be made using the <em>touche sensor</em>, as seen <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Touche-for-Arduino-Advanced-touch-sensing/">here</a>.</p>
