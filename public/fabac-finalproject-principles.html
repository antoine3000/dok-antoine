    Principles
  </h1>
  <p>This project convert the data of a plant and its environment into a an installation which aims to invite us to get closer to nature and to observe how plants live and re/act.</p>

<h2>Represent the health and activity of the plant</h2>

<p>A portable device collects and analyzes light, air temperature and soil moisture level in a plant's environment, as well as its electrical activity.</p>

<p>These values will allow the device to determine how the plant is feeling, according to its needs and whether it is satisfied or not.</p>

<p>The device mimics the mechanisms and movements of the respiration, because it is a very common process between plants and animals, to represent the health and activity of the plant. For example, a plant that is in a good environment "breathes" slowly and deeply, and a plant that is in danger "breathes" briefly and jerky.</p>

<h2>Interact with the living</h2>

<p>A touché sensor, or at least a calibrated capacitive sensor, will allow the device to sense a human-plant interaction and to reveal its nature.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it a caress, a strike or a caring touch?</li>
<li>What does a plant feels when we touch it?</li>
<li>What do we feel when we touch them?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Play with a modular system</h2>

<p>A device is composed by two items. One is the <code>plant</code>, capturing data, linked to a plant. The other one is the <code>clone</code>, showing the health and activity of the plant.</p>

<h3>Data type</h3>

<ul>
<li>Light level</li>
<li>Air temperature level</li>
<li>Soil moisture level</li>
<li>Plant's electrical activity</li>
<li>Plant-human interaction</li>
</ul>

<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>On the <code>plant</code>, one can choose the communication channel (between 1 and 5) which will be used to send the data to the <code>clone</code>.</p>

<p>On the <code>clone</code>, one can choose its communication channel and the types of data that are used to represent the health and activity of the plant.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>plant 01</code> send <code>light</code>, <code>temperature</code> and <code>interaction</code> to  <code>clone 01</code></li>
<li><code>plant 02</code> send <code>activity</code> and <code>moisture</code> to <code>clone 02</code>.</li>
<li><code>plant 03</code> send <code>interaction</code> to <code>clone 03</code></li>
</ul>

<p><img src ="medias/fabac-finalproject-principles-interface.png" alt="interface" /></p>

<p>This kind of configuration allows to build any kind of networks, with several plants and tailor-made visualizations. One plant can be linked to several clones, and vice-versa.</p>

<h3>The panel</h3>

<p>The panel, a wooden structure designed to assemble modules together, can hosts up to 5 <em>clones</em>, creating a more detailed installation that facilitates the understanding of the captured values.</p>

<h2>Public</h2>

<ul>
<li>Massively used in a large room and re-creating a space forest, it invites an audience to interact with plants and clones</li>
<li>A device plugged to an houseplant, acting as a companion in the everyday life</li>
</ul>

<h2>Two possibilities</h2>

<h3>Mechanical system</h3>

<p>My first idea was to have a mechanical system that pushes rods on a flexible material in order to deform it and give it a unique shape according to the sensations of the plant.</p>

<p><img src ="medias/fabac-finalproject-principles-clone01.png" alt="clone" />
<img src ="medias/fabac-finalproject-principles-clone02.png" alt="clone" /></p>

<p>I like this solution because I can easily imagine having total control, mastering the speed / movement ratio of the rods and therefore the shape of the <em>clone</em>.</p>

<p><img src ="medias/fabac-finalproject-principles-clone03.png" alt="clone" />
<img src ="medias/fabac-finalproject-principles-clone04.png" alt="clone" /></p>

<p>But this solution requires a lot of material to be produced, and it will be too expensive compared to the idea that I have of it. I want to build something as affordable and easy to assemble as possible, to make sure it reaches a large audience.</p>

<h3>Inflatable system</h3>

<p>The other system I have in mind uses air pressure to inflate or deflate a flexible bag. This replaces the need for ± 12 motors with a single solenoid and an air pump. The control of the final shape is reduced but also the technical barrier, which is a good point. In addition, the movement should be more organic.</p>
