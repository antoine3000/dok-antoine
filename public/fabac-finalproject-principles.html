      Principles
    
  </h1>
  <p>This project convert the data of a plant and its environment into a an installation which aims to invite us to get closer to nature and to observe how plants live and re/act.</p>

<h2>Representing the plant's health and activity</h2>

<p>A portable device collects and analyzes light, air temperature and soil moisture level in a plant's environment, as well as its electrical activity.</p>

<p>These values will allow the device to determine how the plant is feeling, according to its needs and whether it is satisfied or not.</p>

<p>The device mimics the mechanisms and movements of the respiration, because it is a very common process between plants and animals, to represent the health and activity of the plant. For example, a plant that is in a good environment "breathes" slowly and deeply, and a plant that is in danger "breathes" briefly and jerky.</p>

<h2>Interacting with the living</h2>

<p>A touch√© sensor, or at least a calibrated capacitive sensor, will allow the device to sense a human-plant interaction and to reveal its nature.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it a caress, a strike or a caring touch?</li>
<li>What does a plant feels when we touch it?</li>
<li>What do we feel when we touch them?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Playing with a modular system</h2>

<p>A device is composed by two items. One is the <code>plant</code>, capturing data, linked to a plant. The other one is the <code>clone</code>, showing the plant's health and activity.</p>

<h3>Data type</h3>

<ul>
<li>Light level</li>
<li>Air temperature level</li>
<li>Soil moisture level</li>
<li>Plant's electrical activity</li>
<li>Plant-human interaction</li>
</ul>

<h3>Modular communication</h3>

<p>On the <code>plant</code>, one can choose the communication channel (between 1 and 5) which will be used to send the data to the <code>clone</code>.</p>

<p>On the <code>clone</code>, one can choose its communication channel and the types of data that are used to represent the plant's health and activity.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>plant 01</code> send <code>light</code>, <code>temperature</code> and <code>interaction</code> to  <code>clone 01</code></li>
<li><code>plant 02</code> send <code>activity</code> and <code>moisture</code> to <code>clone 02</code>.</li>
<li><code>plant 03</code> send <code>interaction</code> to <code>clone 03</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This kind of configuration allows to build any kind of networks, with several plants and tailor-made visualizations. One plant can be linked to several clones, and vice-versa.</p>

<h3>The panel</h3>

<p>The panel, a wooden structure designed to assemble modules together, can hosts up to 5 <em>clones</em>, creating a more detailed installation that facilitates the understanding of the captured values.</p>

<h2>Audiences</h2>

<ul>
<li>Massively used in a large room and re-creating a space forest, it invites an audience to interact with plants and clones</li>
<li>A device plugged to an houseplant, acting as a companion in the everyday life</li>
</ul>
