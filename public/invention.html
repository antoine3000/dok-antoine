<p>For the week's assignment, I was asked to develop a dissemination plan for my final project. I'll try to explain my vision for open-source hardware and software, and why I find them absolutely necessary.</p>
<h1 id="project-dissemination-plan">Project dissemination plan</h1>
<h2 id="growing-an-audience">Growing an audience</h2>
<p>I think one of the characteristics of a good project is that it spreads by itself. Only by explaining it to your peers, and if they find it as interesting as you think it is, will you spread the right word to their circle, indirectly expanding your audience.</p>
<h2 id="showing-the-process">Showing the process</h2>
<p>But once the audience increases, you have to have a good tool to maintain it, to cultivate it. For me, the right tools to achieve this are intangible:</p>
<ol>
<li>an honest speech</li>
<li>transparency on the process</li>
<li>clear intentions</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't think an audience can last if it was built on bad marketing decisions or for the sole purpose of enriching the founder of the project. A new project can only find its natural place if its objectives are clear (what is the project for?), its intentions are honest (why does the project exist?) and if the process is transparent (how will the project be in the future?).</p>
<h2 id="opening-everything">Opening everything</h2>
<p>The world is changing, so our way of disseminating projects too. I don't believe in a future where people will continue to trust big business to do everything for them. I want to think that we have reached a peak in the history of globalization and that we are now going back to localization, and therefore to the locally produced product.</p>
<p>To enable people to produce their goods locally, the sources must be shared and the manufacturing process explained and documented.</p>
<h1 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual property</h1>
<p>I think we should all be able to share (copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format) and adapt (remix, transform and build upon the material) whatever we use while still giving the credits appropriate and retaining the same license as the original, as long as it is intended for non-commercial use. This is the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/" target="_blank">BY-NC-SA 4.0</a> license.</p>
<h1 id="potential-incomes">Potential incomes</h1>
<p>As Yuval Noah Harari discusses in his book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind" target="_blank">Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</a>, we all become experts in the tasks we are good at. We specialize in a specific area and then trade our expertise with someone else's.</p>
<p>As a designer/maker/developer (choose whichever you prefer), I think that I'm good at creating tailer-made solutions. Thinking about a problem, solving it, then sharing my solution with others so that they don't have to go through the same process and can jump straight to their very specific problem.</p>
<p>This is why I consider it important to allow the public interested in your project to build a generic version of it by themselves and to let them experience it.</p>
<p>Then, if a specific group of people request a defined feature, or ask to build the project around a specific use, be there and ask to trade your time with other goods (like money, for example).</p>
<p>It's a good way for me to stay expert in an open-source world, while getting paid for your contributions to society.</p>
